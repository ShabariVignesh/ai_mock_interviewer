The C parameter indicates the extent to which you want your SVM to have a soft margin vs a hard margin. Large values of C result in a harder margin that does a better job of correctly classifying the training points but results in a smaller-margin. Conversely, smaller values of C result in a softer margin that creates a larger-margin hyperplane even if it misclassifies more points. Generally, a softer margin is used to prevent overfitting.",3

Further pretrain the model using masked language modeling (BERT-style) or causal LM (GPT-style) objectives to adapt to domain vocabulary and tone. Fine-Tuning: Fine-tune the model on intent classification, slot filling, or response generation tasks using supervised labeled data. Use task-specific heads on top of the transformer encoder/decoder layers. Consider LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) or PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) for faster tuning with fewer parameters. Personalization Techniques: Inject user-specific features (history, preferences) into prompts (prompt tuning) or model embeddings. For persistent memory, use retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to fetch user data during inference. Evaluation: Use metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, F1 for response quality, and accuracy for intent classification.

 It depends on the quality of your data, for example, if your data is biased, just getting more data won’t help.
 It depends on your model. If your model suffers from high bias, getting more data won’t improve your test results beyond a point. You’d need to add more features, etc.

 Variables can be multimodal! If a variable is multimodal then anything based on its mean or median is going to be suspect.",2
Meta,Data Analyst,Technical,Technical,Explain the central limit theorem and give examples of when you can use it in a real-world problem.,"The center limit theorem states that if any random variable, regardless of the distribution, is sampled a large enough time, the sample mean will be approximately normally distributed. This allows for studying the properties of any statistical distribution as long as there is a large enough sample size.
 

 Important remark from Adrian Olszewski: we can rely on the CLT with means (because it applies to any unbiased statistic) only if expressing data in this way makes sense. And it makes sense ONLY in the case of unimodal and symmetric data, coming from additive processes. So forget skewed, multi-modal data with mixtures of distributions, coming from multiplicative processes, and non-trivial mean-variance relationships. That are the places where arithmetic means is meaningless. Thus, using the CLT of e.g. bootstrap will give some valid answers to an invalid question.
 

  the distribution of means isn't enough. Every single kind of inference requires the entire test statistic to follow a certain distribution. And the test statistic consists also of the estimate of variance. Never assume the same sample size sufficient for means will suffice for the entire test statistic. See an excerpt from Rand Wilcox attached. Especially do never believe in magic numbers like N=30.
 

  think first about how to sensible describe your data, state the hypothesis of interest and then apply a valid method.
 

 Examples of real-world usage of CLT:
 

 The CLT can be used at any company with a large amount of data. Consider companies like Uber/Lyft wants to test whether adding a new feature will increase the booked rides or not using hypothesis testing. So if we have a large number of individual ride X, which in this case is a Bernoulli random variable (since the rider will book a ride or not), we can estimate the statistical properties of the total number of bookings. Understanding and estimating these statistical properties play a significant role in applying hypothesis testing to your data and knowing whether adding a new feature will increase the number of booked riders or not.
 

 Manufacturing plants often use the central limit theorem to estimate how many products produced by the plant are defective.",1
Meta,Data Analyst,Technical,Technical,Describe briefly the hypothesis testing and p-value in layman’s term? And give a practical application for them ?,"In Layman's terms:
 

 Hypothesis test is where you have a current state (null hypothesis) and an alternative state (alternative hypothesis). You assess the results of both of the states and see some differences. You want to decide whether the difference is due to the alternative approach or not.
 You use the p-value to decide this, where the p-value is the likelihood of getting the same results the alternative approach achieved if you keep using the existing approach. It's the probability to find the result in the gaussian distribution of the results you may get from the existing approach.
 

 The rule of thumb is to reject the null hypothesis if the p-value < 0.05, which means that the probability to get these results from the existing approach is <95%. But this % changes according to task and domain.
 

 To explain the hypothesis testing in Layman's term with an example, suppose we have two drugs A and B, and we want to determine whether these two drugs are the same or different. This idea of trying to determine whether the drugs are the same or different is called hypothesis testing. The null hypothesis is that the drugs are the same, and the p-value helps us decide whether we should reject the null hypothesis or not.
 

 p-values are numbers between 0 and 1, and in this particular case, it helps us to quantify how confident we should be to conclude that drug A is different from drug B. The closer the p-value is to 0, the more confident we are that the drugs A and B are different.",3
Meta,Business Analyst,Technical,Technical,"Given a left-skewed distribution that has a median of 60, what conclusions can we draw about the mean and the mode of the data?","Left skewed distribution means the tail of the distribution is to the left and the tip is to the right. So the mean which tends to be near outliers (very large or small values) will be shifted towards the left or in other words, towards the tail.
 

 While the mode (which represents the most repeated value) will be near the tip and the median is the middle element independent of the distribution skewness, therefore it will be smaller than the mode and more than the mean.
 

 Mean < 60 Mode > 60",3
Meta,Business Analyst,Technical,Technical,What is the meaning of selection bias and how to avoid it?,"Sampling bias is the phenomenon that occurs when a research study design fails to collect a representative sample of a target population. This typically occurs because the selection criteria for respondents failed to capture a wide enough sampling frame to represent all viewpoints.
 

 The cause of sampling bias almost always owes to one of two conditions.
 

 Poor methodology: In most cases, non-representative samples pop up when researchers set improper parameters for survey research. The most accurate and repeatable sampling method is simple random sampling where a large number of respondents are chosen at random. When researchers stray from random sampling (also called probability sampling), they risk injecting their own selection bias into recruiting respondents.
 

 Poor execution: Sometimes data researchers craft scientifically sound sampling methods, but their work is undermined when field workers cut corners. By reverting to convenience sampling (where the only people studied are those who are easy to reach) or giving up on reaching non-responders, a field worker can jeopardize the careful methodology set up by data scientists.
 

 The best way to avoid sampling bias is to stick to probability-based sampling methods. These include simple random sampling, systematic sampling, cluster sampling, and stratified sampling. In these methodologies, respondents are only chosen through processes of random selection—even if they are sometimes sorted into demographic groups along the way.",3
Meta,Business Analyst,Technical,Technical,Explain the long-tailed distribution and provide three examples of relevant phenomena that have long tails. Why are they important in classification and regression problems?,"A long-tailed distribution is a type of heavy-tailed distribution that has a tail (or tails) that drop off gradually and asymptotically.
 

 Three examples of relevant phenomena that have long tails:
 

 Frequencies of languages spoken
 Population of cities
 Pageviews of articles
 All of these follow something close to 80-20 rule: 80% of outcomes (or outputs) result from 20% of all causes (or inputs) for any given event. This 20% forms the long tail in the distribution.
 

 It’s important to be mindful of long-tailed distributions in classification and regression problems because the least frequently occurring values make up the majority of the population. This can ultimately change the way that you deal with outliers, and it also conflicts with some machine learning techniques with the assumption that the data is normally distributed.",3
Meta,Business Analyst,Technical,Technical,Say you flip a coin 10 times and observe only one head. What would be the null hypothesis and p-value for testing whether the coin is fair or not?,"The null hypothesis is that the coin is fair, and the alternative hypothesis is that the coin is biased. The p-value is the probability of observing the results obtained given that the null hypothesis is true, in this case, the coin is fair.
 

 In total for 10 flips of a coin, there are 2^10 = 1024 possible outcomes and in only 10 of them are there 9 tails and one head.
 

 Hence, the exact probability of the given result is the p-value, which is 10/1024 = 0.0098. Therefore, with a significance level set, for example, at 0.05, we can reject the null hypothesis.",2
Meta,Business Analyst,Technical,Technical,"You are testing hundreds of hypotheses, each with a t-test. What considerations would you take into account when doing this?","The main consideration when we have a large number of tests is that probability of getting a significant test due to chance alone increases. This will increase the type 1 error (rejecting the null hypothesis when it's actually true).
 

 Therefore we need to consider the Bonferroni Effect which happens when we make many tests. Ex. If our significance level is 0.05 but we made a 100 test it means that the probability of getting a value inside the rejection rejoin is 0.0005, not 0.05 so here we need to use another significance level which's called alpha star = significance level /K Where K is the number of the tests.",3
Meta,Data Analyst,Technical,Technical,What general conditions must be satisfied for the central limit theorem to hold?,"In order to apply the central limit theorem, there are four conditions that must be met:
 

 1.** Randomization:** The data must be sampled randomly such that every member in a population has an equal probability of being selected to be in the sample.
 

 Independence: The sample values must be independent of each other.
 

 The 10% Condition: When the sample is drawn without replacement, the sample size should be no larger than 10% of the population.
 

 Large Sample Condition: The sample size needs to be sufficiently large.",1
Meta,Data Analyst,Technical,Technical,What is skewness discuss two methods to measure it?,"Skewness refers to a distortion or asymmetry that deviates from the symmetrical bell curve, or normal distribution, in a set of data. If the curve is shifted to the left or to the right, it is said to be skewed.Skewness can be quantified as a representation of the extent to which a given distribution varies from a normal distribution. There are two main types of skewness negative skew which refers to a longer or fatter tail on the left side of the distribution, while positive skew refers to a longer or fatter tail on the right. These two skews refer to the direction or weight of the distribution.
 

 The mean of positively skewed data will be greater than the median. In a negatively skewed distribution, the exact opposite is the case: the mean of negatively skewed data will be less than the median. If the data graphs symmetrically, the distribution has zero skewness, regardless of how long or fat the tails are.
 

 There are several ways to measure skewness. Pearson’s first and second coefficients of skewness are two common methods. Pearson’s first coefficient of skewness, or Pearson mode skewness, subtracts the mode from the mean and divides the difference by the standard deviation. Pearson’s second coefficient of skewness, or Pearson median skewness, subtracts the median from the mean, multiplies the difference by three, and divides the product by the standard deviation.",2
Meta,Data Analyst,Technical,Technical,"Discuss the Chi-square, ANOVA, and t-test","Chi-square test A statistical method is used to find the difference or correlation between the observed and expected categorical variables in the dataset.
 

 Example: A food delivery company wants to find the relationship between gender, location, and food choices of people.
 

 It is used to determine whether the difference between 2 categorical variables is:
 

 Due to chance or
 

 Due to relationship
 

 Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is a statistical formula used to compare variances across the means (or average) of different groups. A range of scenarios uses it to determine if there is any difference between the means of different groups.
 

 t_test is a statistical method for the comparison of the mean of the two groups of the normally distributed sample(s).
 

 It comes in various types such as:
 

 One sample t-test:
 Used to compare the mean of a sample and the population.
 

 Two sample t-tests:
 Used to compare the mean of two independent samples and whether their population is statistically different.
 

 Paired t-test:
 Used to compare means of different samples from the same group.",1
Meta,Data Analyst,Technical,Technical,"What is the difference between a confidence interval and a prediction interval, and how do you calculate them?","A confidence interval is a range of values that is likely to contain the true value of a population parameter with a certain level of confidence. It is used to estimate the precision or accuracy of a sample statistic, such as a mean or a proportion, based on a sample from a larger population.
 

 For example, if we want to estimate the average height of all adults in a certain region, we can take a random sample of individuals from that region and calculate the sample mean height. Then we can construct a confidence interval for the true population mean height, based on the sample mean and the sample size, with a certain level of confidence, such as 95%. This means that if we repeat the sampling process many times, 95% of the resulting intervals will contain the true population mean height.
 

 The formula for a confidence interval is: confidence interval = sample statistic +/- margin of error
 

 The margin of error depends on the sample size, the standard deviation of the population (or the sample, if the population standard deviation is unknown), and the desired level of confidence. For example, if the sample size is larger or the standard deviation is smaller, the margin of error will be smaller, resulting in a narrower confidence interval.
 

 A prediction interval is a range of values that is likely to contain a future observation or outcome with a certain level of confidence. It is used to estimate the uncertainty or variability of a future value based on a statistical model and the observed data.
 

 For example, if we have a regression model that predicts the sales of a product based on its price and advertising budget, we can use a prediction interval to estimate the range of possible sales for a new product with a certain price and advertising budget, with a certain level of confidence, such as 95%. This means that if we repeat the prediction process many times, 95% of the resulting intervals will contain the true sales value.
 

 The formula for a prediction interval is: prediction interval = point estimate +/- margin of error
 

 The point estimate is the predicted value of the outcome variable based on the model and the input variables. The margin of error depends on the residual standard deviation of the model, which measures the variability of the observed data around the predicted values, and the desired level of confidence. For example, if the residual standard deviation is larger or the level of confidence is higher, the margin of error will be larger, resulting in a wider prediction interval.",3
Meta,Data Analyst,Technical,Technical,What are joins in SQL and discuss its types?,"A JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them. It is used to merge two tables or retrieve data from there. There are 4 types of joins: inner join left join, right join, and full join.
 

 Inner join: Inner Join in SQL is the most common type of join. It is used to return all the rows from multiple tables where the join condition is satisfied.
 Left Join: Left Join in SQL is used to return all the rows from the left table but only the matching rows from the right table where the join condition is fulfilled.
 Right Join: Right Join in SQL is used to return all the rows from the right table but only the matching rows from the left table where the join condition is fulfilled.
 Full Join: Full join returns all the records when there is a match in any of the tables. Therefore, it returns all the rows from the left-hand side table and all the rows from the right-hand side table.",1

Meta,Data Analyst,Technical,Technical,Describe the advantages and disadvantages of relational database vs NoSQL databases,"Advantages of Relational Databases: Ensure data integrity through a defined schema and ACID properties. Easy to get started with and use for small-scale applications. Lends itself well to vertical scaling. Uses an almost standard query language, making learning or switching between types of relational databases easy.
 

 Advantages of NoSQL Databases: Offers more flexibility in data format and representations, which makes working with Unstructured or semistructured data easier. Hence, useful when still the data schema or adding new features/functionality rapidly like in a startup environment to scale with horizontal scaling. Lends itself better to applications that need to be highly available.
 

 Disadvantages of Relational Databases: Data schema needs to be known in advance. Ale schemas is possible, but frequent changes to the schema for large tables can cause performance issues. Horizontal scaling is relatively difficult, leading to eventual performance bottlenecks
 

 Disadvantages of NoSQL Databases: As outlined by the BASE framework, weaker guarantees of data correctness are made due to the soft-state and eventual consistency property. Managing consistency can also be difficult due to the lack of a predefined schema that's strictly adhered to. Depending on the type of NoSQL database, it can be challenging for the database to handle its types of complex queries or access patterns.",1
Meta,Data Analyst,Technical,Technical,What do you understand by Self Join? Explain using an example,"Self-join is as its name implies, joining a table to itself on a database, this process may come in handy in a number of cases, such as:
 

 1- comparing the table's rows to themselves:
 

 It's like we have two copies of the same table and join them together on a given condition to reach the required output query.
 

 Ex. If we have a store database with a client's data table holding a bunch of demographics, we could self-join the client's table to get clients who are located in the same city/made a purchase on the same day/etc.
 

 2- querying a table that has hierarchical data:
 

 Meaning, the table has a primary key that has a one-to-many relationship with another foreign key inside the same table, in other words, the table has data that refers to the same table. We could use self-join in order to have a clear look at the data by matching its keys.
 

 Ex. The organizational structure of a company may contain an employee table that has an employee id and his manager id (who is also an employee, hence has an employee id too) in the same table. Using self-join on this table would allow us to reference every employee directly to his manager.

Meta,Data Analyst,Technical,Technical,What is the difference between temporary tables and common table expressions?,"𝗲𝗺𝗽𝗼𝗿𝗮𝗿𝘆 𝘁𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲𝘀 and 𝗖𝗧𝗘s are both used to store intermediate results in MySQL, but there are some key differences between the two:
 

 𝗗𝗲𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: A temporary table is a physical table that is created in the database and persists until it is explicitly dropped or the session ends. A CTE is a virtual table that is defined only within the scope of a single SQL statement.
 

 𝗦𝘁𝗼𝗿𝗮𝗴𝗲: Temporary tables are stored in the database and occupy physical disk space. CTEs are not stored on disk and exist only in memory for the duration of the query.
 

 𝗔𝗰𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀: Temporary tables can be accessed from any session that has the appropriate privileges. CTEs are only accessible within the scope of the query in which they are defined.
 

 𝗟𝗶𝗳𝗲𝘀𝗽𝗮𝗻: Temporary tables persist until they are explicitly dropped or the session ends. CTEs are only available for the duration of the query in which they are defined and are then discarded.

 𝗣𝘂𝗿𝗽𝗼𝘀𝗲: Temporary tables are typically used to store intermediate results that will be used in multiple queries, while CTEs are used to simplify complex queries by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable parts.
 

 In summary, temporary tables are physical tables that persist in the database and can be accessed from any session, while CTEs are virtual tables that exist only within the scope of a single query and are discarded once the query is complete.

 𝟭. 𝗪𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗽𝗿𝗶𝗺𝗮𝗿𝘆 𝘁𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗶𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗿𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁 𝘁𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲: If the right table contains the primary data that needs to be retrieved, and the left table contains supplementary data, a 𝗥𝗜𝗚𝗛𝗧 𝗝𝗢𝗜𝗡 can be used to retrieve all the data from the right table and matching data from the left table.
 

 𝟮. 𝗪𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗾𝘂𝗲𝗿𝘆 𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗱𝘀 𝘁𝗼 𝗯𝗲 𝗼𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗶𝘇𝗲𝗱: In some cases, a 𝗥𝗜𝗚𝗛𝗧 𝗝𝗢𝗜𝗡 may be more efficient than a 𝗟𝗘𝗙𝗧 𝗝𝗢𝗜𝗡 because the database optimizer can choose the most efficient join order based on the query structure and the available indexes.
 

 𝟯. 𝗪𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗼𝘂𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝗷𝗼𝗶𝗻𝘀: If the query requires an outer join, a 𝗥𝗜𝗚𝗛𝗧 𝗝𝗢𝗜𝗡 may be used to return all the rows from the right table, including those with no matching rows in the left table. It's important to note that while a 𝗥𝗜𝗚𝗛𝗧 𝗝𝗢𝗜𝗡 can provide additional functionality in certain cases, it may also make the query more complex and difficult to read. In most cases, a 𝗟𝗘𝗙𝗧 𝗝𝗢𝗜𝗡 is the preferred method for joining tables in MySQL.",1
Meta,Data Analyst,Technical,Technical,Why Rank skips sequence?,"In MySQL, the rank function may skip a sequence of numbers when using the DENSE_RANK() function or the RANK() function, depending on the data and the query. The DENSE_RANK() function assigns a unique rank to each distinct value in a result set, whereas the RANK() function assigns the same rank to the duplicate values.
 

 Here are some of the reasons why the rank function may skip a sequence in MySQL:
 

 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗗𝗘𝗡𝗦𝗘_𝗥𝗔𝗡𝗞() function skips ranks when there are ties. For example, if there are two rows with the same values in the ranking column, both will be assigned the same rank, and the next rank will be incremented by 1.
 

 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗥𝗔𝗡𝗞() function skips ranks when there are gaps between the duplicate values. For example, if there are three rows with the same values in the ranking column, and then the next row has a higher value, the RANK() function will skip over the fourth rank.
 

 The query may have filtering or grouping clauses that affect the ranking. For example, if a query filters out some rows or groups them by a different column, the ranking may not be sequential.
 

 It's important to note that the ranking function in MySQL behaves differently from the ranking function in other databases, so the same query may produce different results in different database systems.",3
Meta,Machine Learning,Technical,Technical,What are autoencoders? Explain the different layers of autoencoders and mention three practical usages of them?,"Autoencoders are one of the deep learning types used for unsupervised learning. There are key layers of autoencoders, which are the input layer, encoder, bottleneck hidden layer, decoder, and output.
 

 The three layers of the autoencoder are:-
 

 Encoder - Compresses the input data to an encoded representation which is typically much smaller than the input data.
 Latent Space Representation/ Bottleneck/ Code - Compact summary of the input containing the most important features
 Decoder - Decompresses the knowledge representation and reconstructs the data back from its encoded form. Then a loss function is used at the top to compare the input and output images. NOTE- It's a requirement that the dimensionality of the input and output be the same. Everything in the middle can be played with.
 Autoencoders have a wide variety of usage in the real world. The following are some of the popular ones:
 

 Transformers and Big Bird (Autoencoders is one of these components in both algorithms): Text Summarizer, Text Generator
 Image compression
 Nonlinear version of PCA",2
Meta,Machine Learning,Technical,Technical,What is an activation function and discuss the use of an activation function? Explain three different types of activation functions?,"In mathematical terms, the activation function serves as a gate between the current neuron input and its output, going to the next level. Basically, it decides whether neurons should be activated or not. It is used to introduce non-linearity into a model.
 

 Activation functions are added to introduce non-linearity to the network, it doesn't matter how many layers or how many neurons your net has, the output will be linear combinations of the input in the absence of activation functions. In other words, activation functions are what make a linear regression model different from a neural network. We need non-linearity, to capture more complex features and model more complex variations that simple linear models can not capture.
 

 There are a lot of activation functions:
 

 Sigmoid function: f(x) = 1/(1+exp(-x))
 The output value of it is between 0 and 1, we can use it for classification. It has some problems like the gradient vanishing on the extremes, also it is computationally expensive since it uses exp.
 

 Relu: f(x) = max(0,x)
 it returns 0 if the input is negative and the value of the input if the input is positive. It solves the problem of vanishing gradient for the positive side, however, the problem is still on the negative side. It is fast because we use a linear function in it.
 

 Leaky ReLU:
 F(x)= ax, x<0 F(x)= x, x>=0
 

 It solves the problem of vanishing gradient on both sides by returning a value “a” on the negative side and it does the same thing as ReLU for the positive side.
 

 Softmax: it is usually used at the last layer for a classification problem because it returns a set of probabilities, where the sum of them is 1. Moreover, it is compatible with cross-entropy loss, which is usually the loss function for classification problems.",3
Meta,Machine Learning,Technical,Technical,"You are using a deep neural network for a prediction task. After training your model, you notice that it is strongly overfitting the training set and that the performance on the test isn’t good. What can you do to reduce overfitting?","o reduce overfitting in a deep neural network changes can be made in three places/stages: The input data to the network, the network architecture, and the training process:
 

 The input data to the network:
 Check if all the features are available and reliable
 Check if the training sample distribution is the same as the validation and test set distribution. Because if there is a difference in validation set distribution then it is hard for the model to predict as these complex patterns are unknown to the model.
 Check for train / valid data contamination (or leakage)
 The dataset size is enough, if not try data augmentation to increase the data size
 The dataset is balanced
 Network architecture:
 Overfitting could be due to model complexity. Question each component:
 can fully connect layers be replaced with convolutional + pooling layers?
 what is the justification for the number of layers and number of neurons chosen? Given how hard it is to tune these, can a pre-trained model be used?
 Add regularization - lasso (l1), ridge (l2), elastic net (both)
 Add dropouts
 Add batch normalization
 The training process:
 Improvements in validation losses should decide when to stop training. Use callbacks for early stopping when there are no significant changes in the validation loss and restore_best_weights.",2
Meta,Machine Learning,Technical,Technical,Why should we use Batch Normalization?,"Batch normalization is a technique for training very deep neural networks that standardizes the inputs to a layer for each mini-batch.
 

 Usually, a dataset is fed into the network in the form of batches where the distribution of the data differs for every batch size. By doing this, there might be chances of vanishing gradient or exploding gradient when it tries to backpropagate. In order to combat these issues, we can use BN (with irreducible error) layer mostly on the inputs to the layer before the activation function in the previous layer and after fully connected layers.
 

 Batch Normalisation has the following effects on the Neural Network:
 

 Robust Training of the deeper layers of the network.
 Better covariate-shift proof NN Architecture.
 Has a slight regularisation effect.
 Centred and Controlled values of Activation.
 Tries to Prevent exploding/vanishing gradient.
 Faster Training/Convergence to the minimum loss function",2
Meta,Machine Learning,Technical,Technical,How to know whether your model is suffering from the problem of Exploding Gradients?,"By taking incremental steps towards the minimal value, the gradient descent algorithm aims to minimize the error. The weights and biases in a neural network are updated using these processes. However, at times, the steps grow excessively large, resulting in increased updates to weights and bias terms to the point where the weights overflow (or become NaN, that is, Not a Number). An exploding gradient is the result of this, and it is an unstable method.
 

 There are some subtle signs that you may be suffering from exploding gradients during the training of your network, such as:
 

 The model is unable to get traction on your training data (e g. poor loss).
 The model is unstable, resulting in large changes in loss from update to update.
 The model loss goes to NaN during training.
 If you have these types of problems, you can dig deeper to see if you have a problem with exploding gradients. There are some less subtle signs that you can use to confirm that you have exploding gradients:
 

 The model weights quickly become very large during training.
 The model weights go to NaN values during training.
 The error gradient values are consistently above 1.0 for each node and layer during training.",3
Meta,Machine Learning,Technical,Technical,Can you name and explain a few hyperparameters used for training a neural network?,"Hyperparameters are any parameter in the model that affects the performance but is not learned from the data unlike parameters ( weights and biases), the only way to change it is manually by the user.
 

 Number of nodes: number of inputs in each layer.
 

 Batch normalization: normalization/standardization of inputs in a layer.
 

 Learning rate: the rate at which weights are updated.
 

 Dropout rate: percent of nodes to drop temporarily during the forward pass.
 

 Kernel: matrix to perform dot product of image array with
 

 Activation function: defines how the weighted sum of inputs is transformed into outputs (e.g. tanh, sigmoid, softmax, Relu, etc)
 

 Number of epochs: number of passes an algorithm has to perform for training
 

 Batch size: number of samples to pass through the algorithm individually. E.g. if the dataset has 1000 records and we set a batch size of 100 then the dataset will be divided into 10 batches which will be propagated to the algorithm one after another.
 

 Momentum: Momentum can be seen as a learning rate adaptation technique that adds a fraction of the past update vector to the current update vector. This helps damps oscillations and speed up progress towards the minimum.
 

 Optimizers: They focus on getting the learning rate right.
 

 Adagrad optimizer: Adagrad uses a large learning rate for infrequent features and a smaller learning rate for frequent features.
 

 Other optimizers, like Adadelta, RMSProp, and Adam, make further improvements to fine-tuning the learning rate and momentum to get to the optimal weights and bias. Thus getting the learning rate right is key to well-trained models.
 

 Learning Rate: Controls how much to update weights & bias (w+b) terms after training on each batch. Several helpers are used to getting the learning rate right.",1
Meta,Machine Learning,Technical,Technical,Can you explain the parameter sharing concept in deep learning?,"Parameter sharing is the method of sharing weights by all neurons in a particular feature map. Therefore helps to reduce the number of parameters in the whole system, making it computationally cheap. It basically means that the same parameters will be used to represent different transformations in the system. This basically means the same matrix elements may be updated multiple times during backpropagation from varied gradients. The same set of elements will facilitate transformations at more than one layer instead of those from a single layer as conventional. This is usually done in architectures like Siamese that tend to have parallel trunks trained simultaneously. In that case, using shared weights in a few layers( usually the bottom layers) helps the model converge better. This behavior, as observed, can be attributed to more diverse feature representations learned by the system. Since neurons corresponding to the same features are triggered in varied scenarios. Helps to model to generalize better.
 

 Note that sometimes the parameter sharing assumption may not make sense. This is especially the case when the input images to a ConvNet have some specific centered structure, where we should expect, for example, that completely different features should be learned on one side of the image than another.
 

 One practical example is when the input is faces that have been centered in the image. You might expect that different eye-specific or hair-specific features could (and should) be learned in different spatial locations. In that case, it is common to relax the parameter sharing scheme, and instead, simply call the layer a Locally-Connected Layer.",1
Meta,Machine Learning,Technical,Technical,Describe the architecture of a typical Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)?,"In a typical CNN architecture, a few convolutional layers are connected in a cascade style. Each convolutional layer is followed by a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) layer or other activation function, then a pooling layer*, then one or more convolutional layers (+ReLU), then another pooling layer.
 

 The output from each convolution layer is a set of objects called feature maps, generated by a single kernel filter. The feature maps are used to define a new input to the next layer. A common trend is to keep on increasing the number of filters as the size of the image keeps dropping as it passes through the Convolutional and Pooling layers. The size of each kernel filter is usually 3×3 kernel because it can extract the same features which extract from large kernels and faster than them.
 

 After that, the final small image with a large number of filters(which is a 3D output from the above layers) is flattened and passed through fully connected layers. At last, we use a softmax layer with the required number of nodes for classification or use the output of the fully connected layers for some other purpose depending on the task.
 

 The number of these layers can increase depending on the complexity of the data and when they increase you need more data. Stride, Padding, Filter size, Type of Pooling, etc all are Hyperparameters and need to be chosen (maybe based on some previously built successful models)
 

 *Pooling: it is a way to reduce the number of features by choosing a number to represent its neighbor. And it has many types max-pooling, average pooling, and global average.
 

 Max pooling: it takes the max number of window 2×2 as an example and represents this window by using the max number in it then slides on the image to make the same operation.
 Average pooling: it is the same as max-pooling but takes the average of the window.",2
Meta,Machine Learning,Technical,Technical,What is the Vanishing Gradient Problem in Artificial Neural Networks and How to fix it?,"The vanishing gradient problem is encountered in artificial neural networks with gradient-based learning methods and backpropagation. In these learning methods, each of the weights of the neural network receives an update proportional to the partial derivative of the error function with respect to the current weight in each iteration of training. Sometimes when gradients become vanishingly small, this prevents the weight to change value.
 

 When the neural network has many hidden layers, the gradients in the earlier layers will become very low as we multiply the derivatives of each layer. As a result, learning in the earlier layers becomes very slow. 𝐓𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐜𝐚𝐧 𝐜𝐚𝐮𝐬𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐧𝐞𝐮𝐫𝐚𝐥 𝐧𝐞𝐭𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐤 𝐭𝐨 𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐩 𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠. This problem of vanishing gradient descent happens when training neural networks with many layers because the gradient diminishes dramatically as it propagates backward through the network.
 

 Some ways to fix it are:
 

 Use skip/residual connections.
 Using ReLU or Leaky ReLU over sigmoid and tanh activation functions.
 Use models that help propagate gradients to earlier time steps like in GRUs and LSTMs.",1
Meta,Machine Learning,Technical,Technical,"When it comes to training an artificial neural network, what could be the reason why the loss doesn't decrease in a few epochs?","Some of the reasons why the loss doesn't decrease after a few Epochs are:
 

 a) The model is under-fitting the training data.
 

 b) The learning rate of the model is large.
 

 c) The initialization is not proper (like all the weights initialized with 0 doesn't make the network learn any function)
 

 d) The Regularisation hyper-parameter is quite large.
 

 e). The classic case of vanishing gradients",3
Meta,Machine Learning,Technical,Technical,Why Sigmoid or Tanh is not preferred to be used as the activation function in the hidden layer of the neural network?,"A common problem with Tanh or Sigmoid functions is that they saturate. Once saturated, the learning algorithms cannot adapt to the weights and enhance the performance of the model. Thus, Sigmoid or Tanh activation functions prevent the neural network from learning effectively leading to a vanishing gradient problem. The vanishing gradient problem can be addressed with the use of Rectified Linear Activation Function (ReLu) instead of sigmoid and Tanh.",2
Meta,Machine Learning,Technical,Technical,Discuss in what context it is recommended to use transfer learning and when it is not.,"Transfer learning is a machine learning method where a model developed for a task is reused as the starting point for a model on a second task. It is a popular approach in deep learning where pre-trained models are used as the starting point for computer vision and natural language processing tasks given the vast computing and time resources required to develop neural network models on these problems and from the huge jumps in a skill that they provide on related problems.
 

 Transfer learning is used for tasks where the data is too little to train a full-scale model from the beginning. In transfer learning, well-trained, well-constructed networks are used which have learned over large sets and can be used to boost the performance of a dataset.
 

 𝐓𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐬𝐟𝐞𝐫 𝐋𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐜𝐚𝐧 𝐛𝐞 𝐮𝐬𝐞𝐝 𝐢𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐟𝐨𝐥𝐥𝐨𝐰𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐜𝐚𝐬𝐞𝐬:
 

 The downstream task has a very small amount of data available, then we can try using pre-trained model weights by switching the last layer with new layers which we will train.
 

 In some cases, like in vision-related tasks, the initial layers have a common behavior of detecting edges, then a little more complex but still abstract features and so on which is common in all vision tasks, and hence a pre-trained model's initial layers can be used directly. The same thing holds for Language Models too, for example, a model trained in a large Hindi corpus can be transferred and used for other Indo-Aryan Languages with low resources available.

 The first and most important is the ""COST"". So is it cost-effective or we can have a similar performance without using it.
 

 The pre-trained model has no relation to the downstream task.
 

 If the latency is a big constraint (Mostly in NLP ) then transfer learning is not the best option. However Now with the TensorFlow lite kind of platform and Model Distillation, Latency is not a problem anymore.",2
Meta,Machine Learning,Technical,Technical,Discuss the vanishing gradient in RNN and How they can be solved.,"In Sequence to Sequence models such as RNNs, the input sentences might have long-term dependencies for example we might say ""The boy who was wearing a red t-shirt, blue jeans, black shoes, and a white cap and who lives at ... and is 10 years old ...... etc, is genius"" here the verb (is) in the sentence depends on the (boy) i.e if we say (The boys, ......, are genius"". When training an RNN we do backward propagation both through layers and backward through time. Without focusing too much on mathematics, during backward propagation we tend to multiply gradients that are either > 1 or < 1, if the gradients are < 1 and we have about 100 steps backward in time then multiplying 100 numbers that are < 1 will result in a very very tiny gradient causing no change in the weights as we go backward in time (0.1 * 0.1 * 0.1 * .... a 100 times = 10^(-100)) such that in our previous example the word ""is"" doesn't affect its main dependency the word ""boy"" during learning the meanings of the word due to the long description in between.
 

 Models like the Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) and the Long short-term memory (LSTMs) were proposed, the main idea of these models is to use gates to help the network determine which information to keep and which information to discard during learning. Then Transformers were proposed depending on the self-attention mechanism to catch the dependencies between words in the sequence.",1
Meta,Machine Learning,Technical,Technical,What are the main gates in LSTM and what are their tasks?,"There are 3 main types of gates in a LSTM Model, as follows:
 

 Forget Gate
 Input/Update Gate
 Output Gate
 Forget Gate:- It helps in deciding which data to keep or thrown out
 Input Gate:- it helps in determining whether new data should be added in long term memory cell given by previous hidden state and new input data
 Output Gate:- this gate gives out the new hidden state
 Common things for all these gates are they all take take inputs as the current temporal state/input/word/observation and the previous hidden state output and sigmoid activation is mostly used in all of these.",2
Meta,Machine Learning,Technical,Technical,Is it a good idea to use CNN to classify 1D signal?,"For time-series data, where we assume temporal dependence between the values, then convolutional neural networks (CNN) are one of the possible approaches. However the most popular approach to such data is to use recurrent neural networks (RNN), but you can alternatively use CNNs, or a hybrid approach (quasi-recurrent neural networks, QRNN).
 

 With CNN, you would use sliding windows of some width, that would look at certain (learned) patterns in the data, and stack such windows on top of each other, so that higher-level windows would look for patterns within the lower-level patterns. Using such sliding windows may be helpful for finding things such as repeating patterns within the data. One drawback is that it doesn't take into account the temporal or sequential aspect of the 1D signals, which can be very important for prediction.
 

 With RNN, you would use a cell that takes as input the previous hidden state and current input value, to return output and another hidden form, so the information flows via the hidden states and takes into account the temporal dependencies.
 

 QRNN layers mix both approaches.",2
Meta,Machine Learning,Technical,Technical,How does L1/L2 regularization affect a neural network?,"Overfitting occurs in more complex neural network models (many layers, many neurons) and the complexity of the neural network can be reduced by using L1 and L2 regularization as well as dropout , Data augmenration and Dropaout. L1 regularization forces the weight parameters to become zero. L2 regularization forces the weight parameters towards zero (but never exactly zero|| weight deccay )
 

 Smaller weight parameters make some neurons neglectable therfore neural network becomes less complex and less overfitting.
 

 Regularisation has the following benefits:
 

 Reducing the variance of the model over unseen data.
 Makes it feasible to fit much more complicated models without overfitting.
 Reduces the magnitude of weights and biases.
 L1 learns sparse models that is many weights turn out to be 0.",1
Meta,Machine Learning,Technical,Technical,"What might happen if you set the momentum hyperparameter too close to 1 (e.g., 0.9999) when using an SGD optimizer?","If the momentum hyperparameter is set too close to 1 (e.g., 0.99999) when using an SGD optimizer, then the algorithm will likely pick up a lot of speed, hopefully moving roughly toward the global minimum, but its momentum will carry it right past the minimum.
 

 Then it will slow down and come back, accelerate again, overshoot again, and so on. It may oscillate this way many times before converging, so overall it will take much longer to converge than with a smaller momentum value.
 

 Also since the momentum is used to update the weights based on an ""exponential moving average"" of all the previous gradients instead of the current gradient only, this in some sense, combats the instability of the gradients that comes with stochastic gradient descent, the higher the momentum term, the stronger the influence of previous gradients to the current optimization step (with the more recent gradients having even stronger influence), setting a momentum term close to 1, will result in a gradient that is almost a sum of all the previous gradients basically, which might result in an exploding gradient scenario.",1
Meta,Machine Learning,Technical,Technical,What are the hyperparameters that can be optimized for the batch normalization layer?,"he 
 γ
  and 
 β
  hyperparameters for the batch normalization layer are learned end to end by the network. In batch-normalization, the outputs of the intermediate layers are normalized to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. Rescaling by 
 γ
  and shifting by 
 β
  helps us change the mean and standard deviation to other values.",2
Meta,Machine Learning,Technical,Technical,What is the effect of dropout on the training and prediction speed of your deep learning model?,"Dropout is a regularization technique, which zeroes down some weights and scales up the rest of the weights by a factor of 1/(1-p). Let's say if Dropout layer is initialized with p=0.5, that means half of the weights will zeroed down, and rest will be scaled by a factor of 2. This layer is only enabled during training and is disabled during validation and testing. Hence validation and testing is faster. The reason why it works only during training is, we want to reduce the complexity of the model so that model doesn't overfit. Once the model is trained, it doesn't make sense to keep that layer enabled.",3
Meta,Machine Learning,Technical,Technical,What is the advantage of deep learning over traditional machine learning?,"Deep learning offers several advantages over traditional machine learning approaches, including:
 

 Ability to process large amounts of data: Deep learning models can analyze and process massive amounts of data quickly and accurately, making it ideal for tasks such as image recognition or natural language processing.
 

 Automated feature extraction: In traditional machine learning, feature engineering is a crucial step in the model building process. Deep learning models, on the other hand, can automatically learn and extract features from the raw data, reducing the need for human intervention.
 

 Better accuracy: Deep learning models have shown to achieve higher accuracy levels in complex tasks such as speech recognition and image classification when compared to traditional machine learning models.
 

 Adaptability to new data: Deep learning models can adapt and learn from new data, making them suitable for use in dynamic and ever-changing environments.
 

 While deep learning does have its advantages, it also has some limitations, such as requiring large amounts of data and computational resources, making it unsuitable for some applications.",2
Meta,Machine Learning,Technical,Technical,"What is transformer architecture, and why is it widely used in natural language processing tasks?","The key components of a transformer architecture are as follows:
 

 Encoder: The encoder processes the input sequence, such as a sentence or a document, and transforms it into a set of representations that capture the contextual information of each input element. The encoder consists of multiple identical layers, each containing a self-attention mechanism and position-wise feed-forward neural networks. The self-attention mechanism allows the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence while encoding it.
 

 Decoder: The decoder takes the encoded representations generated by the encoder and generates an output sequence. It also consists of multiple identical layers, each containing a self-attention mechanism and additional cross-attention mechanisms. The cross-attention mechanisms enable the decoder to attend to relevant parts of the encoded input sequence when generating the output.
 

 Self-Attention: Self-attention is a mechanism that allows the transformer to weigh the importance of different elements in the input sequence when generating representations. It computes attention scores between each element and every other element in the sequence, resulting in a weighted sum of the values. This process allows the model to capture dependencies and relationships between different elements in the sequence.
 

 Positional Encoding: Transformers incorporate positional encoding to provide information about the order or position of elements in the input sequence. This encoding is added to the input embeddings and allows the model to understand the sequential nature of the data.
 

 Feed-Forward Networks: Transformers utilize feed-forward neural networks to process the representations generated by the attention mechanisms. These networks consist of multiple layers of fully connected neural networks with activation functions, enabling non-linear transformations of the input representations. The transformer architecture is widely used in NLP tasks due to several reasons:
 

 Self-Attention Mechanism: Transformers leverage a self-attention mechanism that allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence during processing. This mechanism enables the model to capture long-range dependencies and contextual information efficiently, making it particularly effective for tasks that involve understanding and generating natural language.
 

 Parallelization: Transformers can process the elements of a sequence in parallel, as opposed to recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that require sequential processing. This parallelization greatly accelerates training and inference, making transformers more computationally efficient.
 

 Scalability: Transformers scale well with the length of input sequences, thanks to the self-attention mechanism. Unlike RNNs, transformers do not suffer from the vanishing or exploding gradient problem, which can hinder the modeling of long sequences. This scalability makes transformers suitable for tasks that involve long texts or documents.
 

 Transfer Learning: Transformers have shown great success in pre-training and transfer learning. Models like BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) are pre-trained on massive amounts of text data, enabling them to learn rich representations of language. These pre-trained models can then be fine-tuned on specific downstream tasks with comparatively smaller datasets, leading to better generalization and improved performance.
 

 Contextual Understanding: Transformers excel in capturing the contextual meaning of words and sentences. By considering the entire input sequence simultaneously, transformers can generate more accurate representations that incorporate global context, allowing for better language understanding and generation.",2
Meta,Machine Learning,Technical,Technical,Explain the key components of a transformer model.,"A transformer model consists of several key components that work together to process and generate representations for input sequences. The main components of a transformer model are as follows:
 

 Encoder: The encoder is responsible for processing the input sequence and generating representations that capture the contextual information of each element. It consists of multiple identical layers, typically stacked on top of each other. Each layer contains two sub-layers: a self-attention mechanism and a position-wise feed-forward neural network.
 

 Self-Attention Mechanism: This mechanism allows the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence while encoding it. It computes attention scores between each element and every other element in the sequence, resulting in a weighted sum of values. This process allows the model to capture dependencies and relationships between different elements.
 

 Position-wise Feed-Forward Neural Network: After the self-attention mechanism, a feed-forward neural network is applied to each position separately. It consists of fully connected layers with activation functions, enabling non-linear transformations of the input representations.
 

 Decoder: The decoder takes the encoded representations generated by the encoder and generates an output sequence. It also consists of multiple identical layers, each containing sub-layers such as self-attention, cross-attention, and position-wise feed-forward networks.
 

 Self-Attention Mechanism: Similar to the encoder, the decoder uses self-attention to attend to different parts of the decoded sequence while generating the output. It allows the decoder to consider the previously generated elements in the output sequence when generating the next element.
 

 Cross-Attention Mechanism: In addition to self-attention, the decoder employs cross-attention to attend to relevant parts of the encoded input sequence. It allows the decoder to align and extract information from the encoded sequence when generating the output.
 

 Self-Attention and Cross-Attention: These attention mechanisms are fundamental components of the transformer architecture. They enable the model to weigh the importance of different elements in the input and output sequences when generating representations. Attention scores are computed by measuring the compatibility between elements, and the weighted sum of values is used to capture contextual dependencies.
 

 Positional Encoding: Transformers incorporate positional encoding to provide information about the order or position of elements in the input sequence. It is added to the input embeddings and allows the model to understand the sequential nature of the data.
 

 Residual Connections and Layer Normalization: Transformers employ residual connections and layer normalization to facilitate the flow of information and improve gradient propagation. Residual connections enable the model to capture both high-level and low-level features, while layer normalization normalizes the inputs to each layer, improving the stability and performance of the model.
 

 These components collectively enable the transformer model to process and generate representations for input sequences in an efficient and effective manner. The self-attention mechanisms, along with the feed-forward networks and positional encoding, allow the model to capture long-range dependencies, handle the parallel processing, and generate high-quality representations, making transformers highly successful in natural language processing tasks.",2
Meta,Machine Learning,Technical,Technical,What are the advantages of transformers over traditional sequence-to-sequence models?,"Transformers have several advantages over traditional sequence-to-sequence models, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), when it comes to natural language processing tasks. Here are some key advantages:
 

 Long-range dependencies: Transformers are capable of capturing long-range dependencies in sequences more effectively compared to RNNs. This is because RNNs suffer from vanishing or exploding gradient problems when processing long sequences, which limits their ability to capture long-term dependencies. Transformers address this issue by using self-attention mechanisms that allow for capturing relationships between any two positions in a sequence, regardless of their distance.
 

 Parallelization: Transformers can process inputs in parallel, making them more efficient in terms of computational time compared to RNNs. In RNNs, the sequential nature of computation limits parallelization since each step depends on the previous step's output. Transformers, on the other hand, process all positions in a sequence simultaneously, enabling efficient parallelization across different positions.
 

 Scalability: Transformers are highly scalable and can handle larger input sequences without significantly increasing computational requirements. In RNNs, the computational complexity grows linearly with the length of the input sequence, making it challenging to process long sequences efficiently. Transformers, with their parallel processing and self-attention mechanisms, maintain a constant computational complexity, making them suitable for longer sequences.
 

 Global context understanding: Transformers capture global context information effectively due to their attention mechanisms. Each position in the sequence attends to all other positions, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the entire sequence during the encoding and decoding process. This global context understanding aids in various NLP tasks, such as machine translation, where the translation of a word can depend on the entire source sentence.
 

 Transfer learning and fine-tuning: Transformers facilitate transfer learning and fine-tuning, which is the ability to pre-train models on large-scale datasets and then adapt them to specific downstream tasks with smaller datasets. Pretraining transformers on massive amounts of data, such as in models like BERT or GPT, helps capture rich language representations that can be fine-tuned for a wide range of NLP tasks, providing significant performance gains.",3
Meta,Machine Learning,Technical,Technical,How does the attention mechanism help transformers capture long-range dependencies in sequences?,"The attention mechanism in transformers plays a crucial role in capturing long-range dependencies in sequences. It allows each position in a sequence to attend to other positions, enabling the model to focus on relevant parts of the input during both the encoding and decoding stages. Here's how the attention mechanism works in transformers:
 

 Self-Attention: Self-attention, also known as intra-attention, is the key component of the attention mechanism in transformers. It computes the importance, or attention weight, that each position in the sequence should assign to other positions. This attention weight determines how much information a position should gather from other positions.
 

 Query, Key, and Value: To compute self-attention, each position in the sequence is associated with three learned vectors: query, key, and value. These vectors are derived from the input embeddings and transformed through linear transformations. The query vector is used to search for relevant information, the key vector represents the positions to which the query attends, and the value vector holds the information content of each position.
 

 Attention Scores: The attention mechanism calculates attention scores between the query vector of a position and the key vectors of all other positions in the sequence. The attention scores quantify the relevance or similarity between positions. They are obtained by taking the dot product between the query and key vectors and scaling it by a factor of the square root of the dimensionality of the key vectors.
 

 Attention Weights: The attention scores are then normalized using the softmax function to obtain attention weights. These weights determine the contribution of each position to the final representation of the current position. Positions with higher attention weights have a stronger influence on the current position's representation.
 

 Weighted Sum: Finally, the attention weights are used to compute a weighted sum of the value vectors. This aggregation of values gives the current position a comprehensive representation that incorporates information from all relevant positions, capturing the long-range dependencies effectively.
 

 By allowing each position to attend to other positions, the attention mechanism provides a mechanism for information to flow across the entire sequence. This enables transformers to capture dependencies between distant positions, even in long sequences, without suffering from the limitations of vanishing or exploding gradients that affect traditional recurrent neural networks. Consequently, transformers excel in modeling complex relationships and dependencies in sequences, making them powerful tools for various tasks, including natural language processing and computer vision.",1
Meta,Machine Learning,Technical,Technical,"What are the limitations of transformers, and what are some potential solutions?","While transformers have revolutionized many natural language processing tasks, they do have certain limitations. Here are some notable limitations of transformers and potential solutions:
 

 Sequential Computation: Transformers process the entire sequence in parallel, which limits their ability to model sequential information explicitly. This can be a disadvantage when tasks require strong sequential reasoning. Potential solutions include incorporating recurrent connections into transformers or using hybrid models that combine the strengths of transformers and recurrent neural networks.
 

 Memory and Computational Requirements: Transformers consume more memory and computational resources compared to traditional sequence models, especially for large-scale models and long sequences. This limits their scalability and deployment on resource-constrained devices. Solutions involve developing more efficient architectures, such as sparse attention mechanisms or approximations, to reduce memory and computational requirements without sacrificing performance significantly.
 

 Lack of Interpretability: Transformers are often considered as black-box models, making it challenging to interpret the reasoning behind their predictions. Understanding the decision-making process of transformers is an ongoing research area. Techniques such as attention visualization, layer-wise relevance propagation, and saliency maps can provide insights into the model's attention and contribution to predictions, enhancing interpretability.
 

 Handling Out-of-Distribution Data: Transformers can struggle with data that significantly deviates from the distribution seen during training. They may make overconfident predictions or produce incorrect outputs when faced with out-of-distribution samples. Solutions include exploring uncertainty estimation techniques, robust training approaches, or incorporating external knowledge sources to improve generalization and handle out-of-distribution scenarios.
 

 Limited Contextual Understanding: Transformers rely heavily on context information to make predictions. However, they can still struggle with understanding the broader context, especially in scenarios with complex background knowledge or multi-modal data. Incorporating external knowledge bases, leveraging graph neural networks, or combining transformers with other modalities like images or graphs can help improve contextual understanding and capture richer representations.
 

 Training Data Requirements: Transformers typically require large amounts of labeled data for effective training due to their high capacity. Acquiring labeled data can be expensive and time-consuming, limiting their applicability to domains with limited labeled datasets. Solutions include exploring semi-supervised learning, active learning, or transfer learning techniques to mitigate the data requirements and leverage pretraining on large-scale datasets.",3
Meta,Business Analyst,Technical,Technical,Differentiate between Oltp and Olap?,"OLTP stands for Online Transaction Process System OLTP is known for maintaining transactional level data of the organization and generally, they are highly normalized. If it is OLTP route then it is going to be a star schema design. OLAP stands for Online Analytical process system. OLAP is known for a lot of analysis and fulfills reporting purposes. It is de-normalized form. If it is an OLAP route then it is going to be a snowflake schema design.",3
Meta,Data Analyst,Technical,Technical,What is a Real time Data Warehouse and how is it different from near to Real time Data Warehouse?,"As the term suggests, a real-time data warehouse is a system, which reflects all changes to its sources in real time. As simple as it sounds, this is still an area of active research in the field. In traditional DWH, the operational system(s) are kept separate from the DWH for a good reason. The Operational systems are designed to accept inputs or changes to data regularly, hence have a good chance of being regularly queried. On the other hand, a DWH is supposed to do just the opposite - it is used to query data for reports only. No changes to data, through user actions is expected (or designed). The only inputs could come from the ETL feed at stipulated times. The ETL would source its data from the Operational systems just explained above. To create a real-time DWH we would have to merge both systems (several ways are being explored), a concept that is against the reason of creating a DWH. Bigger challenges occur in terms of updating aggregated data in facts at real time, still maintaining the surrogate keys. Besides, we would need lightening fast hardware to try this.Near Real time DWH is a trade-off between the conventional design and the dream of all clients today. The frequency of ETL updates in higher in this case for e.g. once in 2 hours. We can also analyze and use selective refreshes at shorter time intervals, while complete refreshes may still be kept further apart. Selective refreshes would look at only those tables that get updated regularly.",2
Meta,Data Analyst,Technical,Technical,What is the main difference between Star and Snowflake Star Schema and which one is better and why?,"If u have one to may relation ship in the data then only we choose snowflake schema, as per the performance-wise every-one go for the Star schema. Moreover, if the ETL is concerned with reporting means choose for snowflake because this schema provides more browsing capability than the former schema.",3
Meta,Data Analyst,Technical,Technical,What is Dimensional Modeling?,"Dimensional Modeling is a design concept used by many data warehouse designers to build their data warehouse. In this design model all the data is stored in two types of tables - Facts table and Dimension table. Fact table contains the facts/measurements of the business and the dimension table contains the context of measurements i.e., the dimensions on which the facts are calculated.Dimension modeling is a method for designing data warehouse. Three types of modeling are there
 

 Conceptual modeling
 Logical modeling
 Physical modeling.",3
Meta,Data Analyst,Technical,Technical,What is Er Diagram?,"The Entity-Relationship (ER) model was originally proposed in 1976 as a way to unify the network and relational database views. Simply stated the ER model is a conceptual data model that views the real world as entities and relationships. A basic component of the model is the Entity-Relationship diagram, which is used to visually represent data objects. Since Chen wrote his paper the model has been extended and today it is commonly used for database design for the database designer, the utility of the ER model is: it maps well to the relational model. The constructs used in the ER model can easily be transformed into relational tables. It is simple and easy to understand with a minimum of training. Therefore, the database designer to communicate the design to the end user can use the model. In addition, the model can be used as a design plan by the database developer to implement a data model in specific database management software.",2
Meta,Data Analyst,Technical,Technical,What is Data Cleaning?,"Data cleaning is a self-explanatory term. Most of the data warehouses in the world source data from multiple systems - systems that were created long before data warehousing was well understood, and hence without the vision to consolidate the same in a single repository of information. In such a scenario, the possibilities of the following are there: ► Missing information for a column from one of the data sources; ► Inconsistent information among different data sources; ► Orphan records; ► Outlier data points; ► Different data types for the same information among various data sources, leading to improper conversion; ► Data breaching business rules In order to ensure that the data warehouse is not infected by any of these discrepancies, it is important to cleanse the data using a set of business rules, before it makes its way into the data warehouse.",3
Meta,Data Analyst,Technical,Technical,Can you explain the Hierarchies Level Data Warehousing?,"In Data warehousing, levels are columns available in dimension table. Levels are having attributes. Hierarchies are used for navigational purpose; there are two types of Hierarchies. You can define hierarchies in top down or bottom up.
 

 Natural Hierarchy: Best example is Time Dimension - Year, Month, Day etc. In natural Hierarchy definite relationship exists between each level
 Navigational Hierarchy: You can have levels like Ex - Production cost of Product, Sales Cost of Product. Ex - Lead Time defined to procure, Actual Procurement time, In this, two levels need not to have relationship. This Hierarchy is created for navigational purpose.",1
